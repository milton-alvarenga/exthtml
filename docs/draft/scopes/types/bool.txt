In programming, a value that can be either true or false is commonly known as a:

Possible values:

    false   False   f   F

Boolean
A Boolean value can be one of two values:

- True: Representing a true or affirmative condition.
- False: Representing a false or negative condition.

In some programming languages, Boolean values can also be represented as:

- Bool: A shorthand for Boolean.

Other terms you might come across include:

- Truthy: A value that evaluates to true in a Boolean context, such as a non-zero number or a non-empty string.
- Falsy: A value that evaluates to false in a Boolean context, such as zero, null, or an empty string.

So, to summarize:

- Boolean: A value that can be either true or false.
- Truthy: A value that evaluates to true in a Boolean context.
- Falsy: A value that evaluates to false in a Boolean context.
