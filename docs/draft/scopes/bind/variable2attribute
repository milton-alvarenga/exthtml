Replace on HTML directive the "" by {} like:
<img src={imageUrl} />


Boolean attributes like disabled can also be bound dynamically:
<button disabled={isDisabled}>Click me</button>
When isDisabled is false, the disabled attribute is removed from the DOM


<script>
  let name = '';
</script>

<input value={name} />
<p>Hello {name}!</p>
